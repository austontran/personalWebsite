      Hi, thanks for coming to my website. This website contains links to various projects that I am currently working on. At this time there are two types of projects that are planned.
      <br>
      The first is a series of actual websites that will have a more defined purpose. The second will be a collection of small minigame like programs that are part of a larger, more
      long term project to develop a game using the Unity engine. 
      <br><br>
      You can find the "About" pages and links to these projects below this section as they become available.
      <br><br>
      If you would like to find out more information about the site you are currently on such as its purpose and development, then click the "About This Site" button below.

      "Night Owl X Moving Mug" is a website for two of my friends to share their musical projects. It features artwork created by the musical artists and the layout is created 
      with their comments and input. I intend to make this site much more visually distinct to practice my UI designing skills as well as creating web solutions to different problems.

      If you would like to check out the site, click the link below. Please note that the site is still in very early stages of developement.
